# Carrot AGNOS 19.8 Bluetooth trial

This experiment is scoped to ajouatom/openpilot `carrot-cinque_v3`. It preserves
the pinned Cinque v3 model and runtime. No rollout to `carrot-wip` is intended.

Base: Carrot builder `ed4d8d5`, merged with commaai/agnos-builder `bdbf1bc`
(AGNOS 19.8). The kernel remains pinned to
`eccd146599f2e2f159d951092642689bede91632` with the existing USB-PD v2/v3
patches on both boot images and the existing C3 PCIe/NVMe patch only on C3.
AGNOS 19.7/19.8 updates AMD GPU firmware and adds Zstandard frame content
sizes needed by newer tinygrad. It also disables unused ALSA state restoration.
Carrot's Adreno library selection is retained. Tinygrad itself is not updated.

Bluetooth port attribution:

- Kernel Bluetooth changes from firestar5683/agnos-kernel-sdm845
  `4ee6b71b8ab9a461248985470726f5917943bc91`, excluding its PCIe/NVMe changes.
- Radio startup adapted from firestar5683/agnos-builder
  `75f04905701f905bf43e60cbf4cfb713039e3f0d`.

Includes native WCN3990 UART enablement, firmware download/baudrate support,
classic HID, BLE HID, RFCOMM, secure pairing crypto, BlueZ and persistent bonds.
Bluetooth firmware is read from the existing active-slot firmware partition;
this release does not flash either Bluetooth firmware partition.
GPS keeps ttyHS0; Bluetooth uses ttyHS1. No USB Bluetooth dongle is required.
USB Bluetooth adapters, audio routing, phone application protocols, and mapping
remote buttons to vehicle commands are outside this bring-up trial.

The radio is opt-in. With the vehicle offroad, on the test device only:

```sh
sudo install -d -m 700 /data/bluetooth
sudo touch /data/bluetooth/ENABLED
sudo systemctl start carrot-bluetooth-radio
bluetoothctl show
bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on
```

Pair only the accessory chosen by the user using interactive `bluetoothctl`:
`agent KeyboardDisplay`, `default-agent`, `pair <address>`, `trust <address>`,
`connect <address>`. Do not auto-accept arbitrary incoming pairing requests.
Verify HID input with `evtest`, BLE with `btmgmt info`, then test reboot and
restart persistence. A phone's Bluetooth menu pairing does not implement a
phone-control application protocol.

To opt out, remove only `/data/bluetooth/ENABLED` and stop
`carrot-bluetooth-radio.service`; existing bonds remain saved.
Build success on both image variants is not C3/C3X hardware validation.
C4 hardware results and rollback information are recorded in the openpilot
experiment document after testing.
